<strong>Nashua, NH</strong><strong> - </strong>Bodrag Software announced today the availability of their RAM Booster Expert ¨C an easy to use and powerful memory optimizer tool that boosts computer performance and makes Windows run much faster and more stable.

RAM Booster Expert¡¯s main feature is memory de-fragmentation. This is extremely useful as many software products, including Windows, load into memory a large amount of libraries that are not constantly used, creating memory blocks. The RAM Boost Expert from Bodrag finds these blocks and unloads them to a page file. When some of this data becomes necessary, it is loaded back to the RAM.

The software also operates when applications close: occasionally, not the entire allocated memory is released and RAM Booster Expert finds these memory leaks and flushes them, increasing the size of free memory.

Optimization processes can be scheduled to run when the user is away from the computer. The application shows detailed information about physical memory (total, free and used), page file (total, free and used), clipboard content and CPU usage. This information is displayed in text and graphical mode.

Also, the RAM Booster Expert is supplied with two other useful tools: Process and Startup Manager. The Process Manager allows the user to view detailed information about running processes and to stop them if necessary. The Startup Manager helps the user view and delete applications that start on Windows startup.

RAM Booster Expert 1.00 can be bought online from Bodrag¡¯s website, at <a  href="http://www.bodrag.com/">http://www.bodrag.com</a>. The price of a single copy is $24.95 Dollars.
